 #Welcome to Canada
 canada.1.t:9 "Welcome to Canada - Message from the Canadian Dev"
 canada.1.d:9 "Thanks for playing as Canada in the WW1 Redux Mod. There are some things you should consider while playing Canada. You have four options to go down in the focus tree; §C1.Historical§!, §G2.Freedom Historical§!, §B3.Freedom Liberty§!, and §R4.Monarchist Canada§!. I have tried to make the focus tree as plausible as I can, while including a fun game experience. I have also made the focuses as historical as possible, with many references for your immersion. This is the beta version of Canada, and I will be adding much more later!\n Some things to note is that I have not finished a lot of the GFX, so stay tuned, and I will be implementing a Canadian navy when the Mod has finished the navy rework.\nHave fun and I hope you like playing this mod with Canada!\n\n-PrometheusNavagadro"
